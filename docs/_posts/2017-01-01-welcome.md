Welcome to the HumanReadable blog. On these pages I hope to provide interesting insights into the world of computers.

As a software developer I am constantly exploring new technologies and tinkering with a wide variety of tools. This blog is intended to share some of those ideas and learnings.

Some ideas for topics I may tackle in the future:

* Implementing CICD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) pipeline using Jenkins
* Automated web-ui testing with selenium API using Java
* Load testing with Java and jmeter on DigitalOcean
* Webdriver.io using Selenium with Node.js
* Load testing with Python and locust.io on DigitalOcean
* Automated testing of JSON APIs using Rest-Assured
* Memory Monitoring java applications on Linux
* Linux performance monitoring
* Introduction to running Hyper-SQL database server

I hope to provide concise, useful and interesting articles on these and other topics.

Please check back soon for more articles!
