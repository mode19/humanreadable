I believe it was Albert Einstein that said: "If you're not learning you're dying".  Thruthfully, this quote and attribution come to me via pinterest but regardless of the source, the idea rings true to me. The mental state of learning is not something to turn to periodically when life requires it but rather a process that is part of life itself.

As a software developer I am constantly exploring new technologies and tinkering with a wide variety of tools. This blog is intended to share some of those ideas and learnings.

Some ideas for topics I may tackle in the future:
