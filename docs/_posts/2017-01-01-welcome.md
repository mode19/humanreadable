Welcome to the HumanReadable blog, here I hope to provide interesting insights into the world of computers.

As a software developer I am constantly exploring new technologies and tinkering a wide variety of tools. This blog is intended to share some of those ideas and learnings.

Some ideas for topic I may tackle in the future:

* Load testing with Python and locust.io on DigitalOcean
* Load testing with Java and jmeter on DigitalOcean
* Implementing CICD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) pipeline using Jenkins
* Automated web testing with selenium API using Java
* selenium.io webdriver with nodejs
* Automated testing of JSON APIs using RestAssured
* Memory Monitoring java applications on Linux
* Linux performance monitoring

I hope to provide concise, useful and interesting articles to help you do just that.

Check back for more articles soon!
